Demo on Serilog and AutoMapper

Serilog is an open-source logging library for .NET and other platforms, designed to provide a simple, 
efficient and flexible logging solution for modern applications. It is based on the concept of structured logging, 
where log events are treated as data, rather than simple strings, making it easier to search, analyze, and visualize log data.

With Serilog, you can log messages at different levels of severity, such as debug, informational, warning, error, and fatal, 
and you can include rich context information, such as properties and metadata, in each log event. The library also supports 
various logging sinks, including files, databases, message queues, and cloud-based services, allowing you to route log data 
to the appropriate destination based on your needs.

In summary, Serilog is a modern logging library that provides a powerful, yet easy-to-use logging solution for .NET applications, 
making it easier to collect and analyze log data, and troubleshoot issues more effectively.

Advantages:
1. Structured Logging: Serilog provides structured logging, meaning that log events are treated as data rather than just strings.
This makes it easier to search, analyze, and visualize log data.

2. Flexible Sink Support: Serilog supports a wide range of logging sinks, including files, databases, message queues, and 
cloud-based services, allowing you to route log data to the appropriate destination based on your needs.

3.Easy to Use: Serilog is easy to use, with a simple API and intuitive syntax that makes it easy to start logging right away. 
It also has a number of built-in features, such as automatic log context, that make it easier to add valuable context 
information to your log events.

4.High Performance: Serilog is designed to be fast and efficient, even when dealing with large amounts of log data. 
It uses efficient data structures, buffering, and batching, to ensure that log data is processed quickly and efficiently.

5.Customizable: Serilog is highly customizable, allowing you to change the way that log data is processed, routed, and stored, 
to meet the specific needs of your application.

6.Cross-Platform: Serilog is designed to work across multiple platforms, including .NET, .NET Core, and other platforms, 
making it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications.

In summary, Serilog provides a powerful and flexible logging solution that is easy to use, high performance, and customizable,
making it an excellent choice for modern applications.

Serilog has been designed with performance in mind, and it has been benchmarked to perform well for many common use cases. 
However, the actual performance will depend on factors such as the number of log messages being generated, the complexity 
of the log messages, and the number of sinks being used to store the log messages.

AutoMapper is a .NET library that provides a simple and efficient way to map between objects. It automatically maps objects from one type to another, taking care of the details of mapping properties and field values from one type to another.

The main advantage of using AutoMapper is that it reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed for object mapping, making it easier and more efficient to map between objects. It also provides a clear and maintainable way to map between objects, which can save time and effort in the long run, especially in complex mapping scenarios.

Another advantage of AutoMapper is its ability to perform complex mapping operations. For example, it can perform mapping operations that involve nested objects, flattening, and merging of objects, among others.

AutoMapper also provides a way to customize the mapping process by using mapping profiles, where custom mapping rules can be defined for specific types. This allows for fine-grained control over the mapping process, making it possible to handle complex mapping scenarios.

Overall, AutoMapper is a useful tool for reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed for object mapping and providing a clear and maintainable way to map between objects.
